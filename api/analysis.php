            <h2>Relevance to Contemporary Issues</h2>
            <p>
                The themes explored in <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> remain deeply relevant to modern society, as they reflect ongoing struggles for justice, freedom, and equality. The novel’s portrayal of social injustice, political corruption, and the fight for freedom resonates with contemporary issues in various parts of the world, particularly in nations grappling with corrupt governance and social inequality.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Social Injustice:</strong> Rizal’s depiction of the oppressive social hierarchy under Spanish colonial rule highlights the struggles of marginalized groups, such as the poor and women. In today's world, similar issues of economic disparity, systemic discrimination, and social exclusion continue to affect many societies. The exploitation of the underprivileged by powerful elites is a theme that finds echoes in modern-day protests and movements for social justice, such as the fight for workers' rights, the push for gender equality, and the battle against racism.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Political Corruption:</strong> The corrupt actions of the Spanish authorities in the novel, especially the friars and local officials, mirror the corruption that still pervades political systems worldwide. Whether in the form of bribery, abuse of power, or lack of accountability, political corruption continues to undermine democratic processes and stifle progress. The novel’s critique of these abuses serves as a call for transparency, justice, and ethical leadership—values that are still crucial in the fight against government corruption in contemporary times.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The Struggle for Freedom:</strong> <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> is ultimately a story about the yearning for freedom and self-determination. Ibarra’s journey reflects the struggle of oppressed peoples to break free from the chains of tyranny. In modern-day contexts, the fight for freedom manifests in various forms: resistance against authoritarian regimes, the pursuit of civil rights, and the fight for political independence. The novel’s message of hope and resistance continues to inspire movements for liberty and justice worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, the themes of <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> are timeless. The struggles faced by the characters in the novel—against corruption, injustice, and the denial of basic freedoms—are not confined to the past but remain relevant today. Rizal’s work continues to serve as both a historical reflection and a call to action, urging readers to address these societal issues and work toward a more just and equitable world.
